Overview:
The purpose of the analysis is to take the original data and process it into something more digestible.
By having both a line graph and summary dataframe we can see how the total fares change over time but seeing the summary values makes it easier to see if there is something wrong with the data that we would not be able to see otherwise.

Results:
The biggest surprise was how little the average fare for driver is in urban areas and how many drivers there are.
It seems like there are decreases in travel after the start of the year so changing the price depending on the time of year.

Summary:
To increase the amount of fare per driver it may be better to reduce the number of total drivers for urban areas.
It may also help to decrease fares in rural areas.
